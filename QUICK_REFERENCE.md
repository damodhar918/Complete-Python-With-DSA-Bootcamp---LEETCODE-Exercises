## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Do's ✅
- ✅ Start with beginner exercises
- ✅ Run test cases frequently
- ✅ Try solving before looking at solution
- ✅ Practice daily (even 30 min helps)
- ✅ Review difficult problems multiple times

### Don'ts ❌
- ❌ Skip fundamentals
- ❌ Memorize solutions
- ❌ Jump to hard problems
- ❌ Skip test cases
- ❌ Cram (consistency > intensity)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | `pip install <module>` |
| `NameError` | Run foundation cells first |
| Cell won't run | Check syntax, restart kernel |
| Can't open notebook | Check file path, restart Jupyter |
